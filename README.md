# T-Slot Nut Holder Design

This was my first 3D model when working with my original Thing-o-Matic 3D
printer.  It's a small holder that helps with positioning and supporting hex
nuts.

## The Problem

When assembling the Thing-o-Matic printer, I found the t-slot construction
technique to be quite cool at first. After needing to take a few things apart
and put them back together, I found the standard advice to be annoying.

The issue is that you have to slide a hex nut into this little gap in the wood
or acrylic of the printer and run a screw perpendicular to it to engage the
nut. Since the nut capture opening was open on both sides, the nut regularly
falls out when you are trying to put the screw in place. The advice from the
mailing list was to tape the nut in place and then remove the tape afterwards.

## My Solution

During yet another session of tweaking the hardware, I realized that this would
not be a problem if I had something *T*-shaped that holds the nut, fits the
slot, and can't fall through because of the top of the *T*. By giving the
holder a bottom that the nut rests on, we also spread the force applied to the
nut during tightening. This solved a problem I was already seeing with parts of
the plywood beginning to break down under some parts of the nut. Since the nut
isn't perfectly flat, some parts were compressed more than others.
